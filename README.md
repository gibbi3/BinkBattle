# BinkBattle
Pictures of my cat compete for clicks. Two different versions are included. One is programmed with vanilla JS, the other with Knockout.js.
The versions do differ in design, but they both essentially do the same thing.

## Installation
Despite the version chosen to run, all that is necessary for installation is the presence of all the files in either directory. 

## Use
All that is required for use is a browser. Simply run 'index.html', and you're good to go!
